Evaluates KaRL logic from command line or file.

options:
  [-a|--after-wait]        Evaluate after wait, rather than before wait
  [-b|--broadcast ip:port] the broadcast ip to send and listen to
  [-c|--check-result]      check result of eval. If not zero, then terminate
  [-d|--domain domain]     the knowledge domain to send and listen to
  [--debug]                print all sent, received, and final knowledge
  [-f|--logfile file]      log to a file
  [-h|--help]              print help menu (i.e., this menu)
  [-i|--input file]        file containing MADARA logic to evaluate
  [-k|--print-knowledge]   print final knowledge
  [-ky]                    print knowledge after frequent evaluations
  [-l|--level level]       the logger level (0+, higher is higher detail)
  [-m|--multicast ip:port] the multicast ip to send and listen to
  [-o|--host hostname]     the hostname of this process (def:localhost)
  [-q|--queue-length size] size of network buffers in bytes
  [-r|--reduced]           use the reduced message header
  [-s|--save file]         save the resulting knowledge base as karl
  [-t|--time time]         time to wait for results
  [-u|--udp ip:port]       the udp ips to send to (first is self to bind to)
  [-w|--wait seconds]      Wait for number of seconds before exiting
  [-wy|-wp|--wait-for-periodic seconds]  Wait for number of seconds
                           before performing periodic evaluation
  [-y|--frequency hz]      frequency to perform evaluation. If negative,
                           only runs once. If zero, hertz is infinite.
                           If positive, hertz is that hertz rate.
  [--zmq|--0mq proto://ip:port] a ZeroMQ endpoint to connect to.
                           examples include tcp://127.0.0.1:30000
                           or any of the other endpoint types like
                           pgm://. For tcp, remember that the first
                           endpoint defined must be your own, the
                           one you are binding to, and all other
                           agent endpoints must also be defined or
                           no messages will ever be sent to them.
                           Similarly, all agents will have to have
                           this endpoint added to their list or
                           this karl agent will not see them.s
  [-0|--init-logic logic]  logic containing initial variables (only ran once)
  [-0f|--init-file file]   file containing initial variables (only ran once)
