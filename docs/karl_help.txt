Program summary for karl [options] [Logic]:

Evaluates KaRL logic from command line or file.

options:
  [-a|--after-wait]        Evaluate after wait, rather than before wait
  [-b|--broadcast ip:port] the broadcast ip to send and listen to
  [-c|--check-result]      check result of eval. If not zero, then terminate
  [-d|--domain domain]     the knowledge domain to send and listen to
  [--debug]                print all sent, received, and final knowledge
  [-f|--logfile file]      log to a file
  [-h|--help]              print help menu (i.e., this menu)
  [-i|--input file]        file containing MADARA logic to evaluate
  [-k|--print-knowledge]   print final knowledge
  [-kp]--print-prefix      filter prints by prefix. Can be multiple.
  [-ky]                    print knowledge after frequent evaluations
  [-l|--level level]       the logger level (0+, higher is higher detail)
  [-lt|--load-transport file] a file to load transport settings from
  [-ltp|--load-transport-prefix prfx] prefix of saved settings
  [-ltt|--load-transport-text file] a text file to load transport settings from
  [-m|--multicast ip:port] the multicast ip to send and listen to
  [-o|--host hostname]     the hostname of this process (def:localhost)
  [-q|--queue-length size] size of network buffers in bytes
  [-r|--reduced]           use the reduced message header
  [-s|--save file]         save the resulting knowledge base as karl
  [-sb|--save-binary file] save the resulting knowledge base as a
                           binary checkpoint
  [-sj|--save-json file]   save the resulting knowledge base as JSON
  [-st|--save-transport file] a file to save transport settings to
  [-stp|--save-transport-prefix prfx] prefix to save settings at
  [-stt|--save-transport-text file] a text file to save transport settings to
  [-t|--time time]         time to wait for results. Same as -w.
  [-u|--udp ip:port]       the udp ips to send to (first is self to bind to)
  [-w|--wait seconds]      Wait for number of seconds before exiting
  [-wy|-wp|--wait-for-periodic seconds]  Wait for number of seconds
                           before performing periodic evaluation
  [-y|--frequency hz]      frequency to perform evaluation. If negative,
                           only runs once. If zero, hertz is infinite.
                           If positive, hertz is that hertz rate.
  [--zmq|--0mq proto://ip:port] a ZeroMQ endpoint to connect to.
                           examples include tcp://127.0.0.1:30000
                           or any of the other endpoint types like
                           pgm://. For tcp, remember that the first
                           endpoint defined must be your own, the
                           one you are binding to, and all other
                           agent endpoints must also be defined or
                           no messages will ever be sent to them.
                           Similarly, all agents will have to have
                           this endpoint added to their list or
                           this karl agent will not see them.s
  [-0|--init-logic logic]  logic containing initial variables (only ran once)
  [-0f|--init-file file]   file containing initial variables (only ran once)
  [-0b|--init-bin file]    file containing binary knowledge base, the result
                           of save_context (only ran once)
  [--meta-prefix prefix]   store checkpoint meta data at knowledge prefix
  [--use-id]               use the id of the checkpointed binary load
